# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their demographic and spending behavior using clustering techniques. The dataset used is the popular **Mall Customers dataset**, and the project leverages **KMeans Clustering** for unsupervised learning.

📊 This repository also includes a **Power BI dashboard** for an interactive and visual understanding of the segmented customer groups.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Retail and marketing businesses often need to understand their customer base to tailor products, offers, and campaigns effectively. Customer segmentation helps group similar customers together, enabling data-driven business strategies.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `Mall_Customers.csv`, which contains the following features:

- 🆔 `CustomerID`
- 🚻 `Gender`
- 👤 `Age`
- 💰 `Annual Income (k$)`
- 📈 `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- 🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)
- 📉 Unsupervised Learning (KMeans Clustering)
- 📊 Power BI (for interactive dashboard visualizations)

## 📌 Methodology

1. 📥 **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Basic EDA to understand data structure, check for null values, and summarize distributions.

2. 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Removed duplicates and missing values (if any)  

3. 🔍 **Clustering**  
   - Used **KMeans Clustering**  
   - Applied the **Elbow Method** to find optimal number of clusters  
   - Visualized customer segments in 2D

4. 🧠 **Interpretation**  
   - Analyzed different segments based on income and spending scores  
   - Derived business insights from each cluster

5. 📊 **Power BI Dashboard**  
   An interactive dashboard to explore the clusters, gender distribution, age analysis, and income vs. spending trends.
